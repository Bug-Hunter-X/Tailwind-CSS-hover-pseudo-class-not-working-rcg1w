//Possible solutions:
//1. Check for conflicting CSS: Ensure that no other CSS rules are overriding Tailwind's hover styles. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the element and check its computed styles.
//2. Verify class application: Double-check that the Tailwind classes are correctly applied to the button element, with no typos or extra spaces.
//3. JavaScript interference: If you're using JavaScript to manipulate the element's styles, ensure that your JavaScript code isn't unintentionally interfering with Tailwind's hover styles. Try disabling or commenting out your JavaScript to see if that solves the issue.
//4. Parent element issues:  Check if a parent element has a style like `pointer-events: none;` which can prevent hover events from reaching the button. 
//5. Correct HTML structure: Make sure the button is properly nested within the correct parent elements and is not hidden by other styles.
//6. Update Tailwind: Ensure that your Tailwind CSS version is up-to-date. Older versions may contain bugs that have since been fixed.
//7. Purge unused CSS: If you're using Tailwind's purge functionality (as recommended), ensure that the button class is actually used in your application so the CSS is not removed during the build process.
//Example of solution (assuming a conflicting class was found)
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded !important">Hover me</button>
