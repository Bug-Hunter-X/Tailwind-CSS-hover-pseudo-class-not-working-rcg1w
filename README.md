# Tailwind CSS Hover Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS's hover pseudo-class selector doesn't work as expected on a button element. The button's background color should change on hover, but it remains unchanged.

## Bug Description
The hover effect is not applying to the button element, even though the Tailwind classes are correctly implemented. This issue might be caused by conflicting CSS rules, incorrect class application, or issues with JavaScript interfering with the element's styling.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Hover over the button. You'll observe that the background color does not change.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying the following factors and potential debugging steps to identify and resolve the underlying cause.  See bugSolution.js and index.html for examples.
